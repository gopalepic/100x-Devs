Where objects are stored in a database 

a objects is mp4 files , audion , images etc...
because these things are not stored in databases like mondo , postgres...

AWS provides S3(simple storage service)

it stores the files , it provied  correspoding link to use 

but thats a bad practice 

CDNs (Content Delievery Networks)

it distributes your files at different places , it caches the data , and if the user is requsting those fiels , then , the files will we coming back from the nearest cached data center of AWS , 

 Why only frontends are deployed on cloudFronts, why not backends 

 foreg => i am accessing a website at port beEpic.com , let say , 1000 people are also accessing the same website , so what i am watching that would be same for those other 1000 people 

 but in case of backends , if i am going on /me route ,
 and 1000 people are also going on /me port , each and every user will have different data 

 thatways only data like images,video .... etc can only be catched not the backend part
